                            TEST OF TIME

                    Once upon a time, there was a test. A
                    test that only a few could answer. In 
                    a time that there is really not much to
                    do, a poet was sitting upon a well.

                                POET
                        Well, what have we here?

                He reaches out and grabs a bright blue stone.

                                POET
                        An interesting rock I suppose? What 
                        treasures might it hide or stories
                        it pray tells?

                The poet hops down to the ground. He begins
                walking on the road until he finds an inn.
                Once at the door, he knocks and opens to find
                a tavern.
                Folks sitting, drinking and chatting. A peaceful
                atmosphere, until the poet enters and all eyes 
                land on him.

                                MAN1
                        Well, well, well, look-ey what we 
                        have here.

                                POET
                        Surely you don't mean me good sir.

                                MAN1
                        Why of course I do. What would a man
                        like you be doing with the Stone of
                        Souls?
